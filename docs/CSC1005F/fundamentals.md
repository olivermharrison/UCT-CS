> **Program** - A sequence of instructions telling a computer what to do.

> **Algorithm** - A set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem solving operations.

> **Syntax** - _form_  
> **Semantics** - _meaning_

> **Psuedocode** - Precise English that describes what a program does. 

## Hardware

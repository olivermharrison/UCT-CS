# Searching

## Linear Search
> Start at one end of the list and check each element until item is found or the list ends. 

* Best Case: `O(1)`
* Avg. Case: `O(n)`
* Worst Case: `O(n)`

## Binary Search
For sorted lists:
> 1. Determine which half contains the item  
> 2. Recursively search that half  
> 3. Stop when the item is found of when the list is empty

* Best Case: `O(1)`
* Avg. Case: `O(logn)`
* Worst Case: `O(logn)`

```
